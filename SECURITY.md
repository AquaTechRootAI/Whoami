## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc


Here's an updated security policy for your GitHub repository, incorporating an internal security breach prevention strategy:

---

## Security Policy

### 1. Purpose
This security policy aims to protect the intellectual property, code, and ideas contained within this repository. It ensures that only authorized individuals can access, modify, or distribute the code, establishes a payment system for external usage, and includes measures to prevent internal security breaches.

### 2. Scope
This policy applies to all contributors, maintainers, and users of this repository. It covers all code, documentation, and other resources contained within the repository.

### 3. Copyright Protection
- All code, documentation, and related materials are copyrighted by [Your Organization/Enterprise Name] and are protected under [appropriate jurisdiction] copyright laws.
- Unauthorized copying, distribution, or use of any content within this repository is strictly prohibited and may result in legal action.

### 4. Encryption
- All code lines must be encrypted using double encryption techniques to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.
- Encryption must be implemented as follows:
  - First layer: AES-256 encryption.
  - Second layer: RSA encryption with a minimum key length of 4096 bits.
- Only owners of the organization or enterprise have access to the decryption keys.

### 5. Access Control
- Access to the repository is restricted to authorized personnel only.
- Only members of [Your Organization/Enterprise Name] with appropriate permissions can decrypt and access the code.
- Access levels are defined as follows:
  - **Owner:** Full access to all features and settings within the repository.
  - **Maintainer:** Access to manage issues, pull requests, and code review processes.
  - **Contributor:** Access to submit pull requests and issues.
  - **Viewer:** Read-only access to the repository (excluding encrypted code).

### 6. Payment for Forks and Usage
- Any individual or organization that forks or uses the code from this repository, apart from the authorized owners, is required to make a payment.
- The payment terms are as follows:
  - **Forking the Repository:** A one-time payment of [specified amount] is required upon forking the repository.
  - **Using the Code:** A subscription payment of [specified amount] per month is required for using any part of the code.
- Payments must be made through [specified payment system, e.g., PayPal, Stripe].

### 7. Internal Security Breach Prevention Strategy
To prevent internal security breaches, the following measures are implemented:

#### 7.1 User Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all users accessing the repository.
- Strong password policies must be enforced, including regular password updates.

#### 7.2 Access Monitoring
- Continuous monitoring of user activities within the repository.
- Logging all access attempts and actions performed, with logs reviewed regularly.

#### 7.3 Least Privilege Principle
- Users are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their duties.
- Regular reviews of user access levels to ensure compliance with the principle of least privilege.

#### 7.4 Secure Development Practices
- All code changes must go through peer review before being merged into the main branch.
- Implement automated security testing as part of the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

#### 7.5 Incident Response
- Establish an incident response team responsible for handling security breaches.
- Develop and maintain an incident response plan detailing the steps to take in case of a breach.

#### 7.6 Security Awareness Training
- Regular security training sessions for all contributors and maintainers.
- Updates on the latest security threats and best practices.

### 8. Security Practices
- All contributors must follow secure coding practices and regularly review code for potential security vulnerabilities.
- Regular audits and security reviews will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy.
- Sensitive data, including passwords and API keys, must never be committed to the repository.

### 9. Incident Response
- Any security incidents, including unauthorized access or data breaches, must be reported immediately to the security team at [security@example.com].
- The security team will investigate and respond to incidents promptly, following established incident response procedures.

### 10. Compliance
- All users of this repository must comply with this security policy.
- Non-compliance with this policy may result in revocation of access privileges and/or legal action.

### 11. Policy Review
- This security policy will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to address new security threats and compliance requirements.

### 12. Contact Information
For any questions or concerns regarding this security policy, please contact the security team at [security@example.com].

Ensure that you replace placeholders (e.g., [Your Organization/Enterprise Name], [appropriate jurisdiction], [specified amount], [specified payment system], [security@example.com]) with the actual information relevant to your organization. 

Additionally, integrating these security measures might require the use of tools and services like GitHub Actions for CI/CD, third-party security scanners, and authentication services that support MFA.
